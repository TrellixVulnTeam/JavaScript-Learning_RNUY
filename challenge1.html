        <h3>Challenge 1</h3>
    <h4>
        <pre>
        Mark and John are trying to compare their BMI (Body Mass Index), which is
        calculated using the formula:
        BMI = mass / height ** 2 = mass / (height * height) (mass in kg
        and height in meter).
        </pre>
    </h4>
        <pre>
        Your tasks:
        1. Store Mark's and John's mass and height in variables
        2. Calculate both their BMIs using the formula (you can even implement both
        versions)
        3. Create a Boolean variable 'markHigherBMI' containing information about
        whether Mark has a higher BMI than John.

      let markMass=90;// in kg
      let markHeight=1.8;// in meter
      let johnMass=75;
      let johnHeight=1.75;
      //  BMI = mass/height ** 2;
      //  BMI = mass/ (height * height);
      let BMI_mark= markMass/(markHeight * markHeight);
      let BMI_john= johnMass/(johnHeight * johnHeight);
      let markHigherBMI=BMI_mark > BMI_john;
      console.log("BMI of mark is: "+BMI_mark);
      console.log("BMI of john is: "+BMI_john);

      console.log("isMarkBmiHigher: "+markHigherBMI);
      console.log("Congrats mark and john ðŸ˜Ž ");
